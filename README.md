## Introduction

**Autonomous operations** is the convergence of AI, observability, and reliability engineering. It's not just about chatbots answering questions — it's about AI agents that can **diagnose incidents**, **execute remediation runbooks**, **navigate ops consoles**, and **coordinate across toolchains** with appropriate safety guardrails.

This list curates the essential building blocks for AI-powered SRE, DevOps, and SecOps workflows: graph-based root cause analysis over logs and metrics, agentic systems that troubleshoot and heal production, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that safely expose operational tools to AI, and browser automation frameworks that let agents interact with dashboards and consoles. Whether you're building intelligent on-call assistants, autonomous incident responders, or AI-augmented support fabrics, these projects represent the state of the art.

The goal is to provide a **reference architecture** for practitioners: clear, composable, and production-minded tools that respect the complexity and criticality of real-world operations.

## How to Use This List

This list is organized as a **composable reference architecture** for AI-powered autonomous operations:

**Start with observability and RCA**: Use Graph RAG and root cause analysis tools to give your agents the ability to understand what's happening in your systems. Tools like AutoRCA-Core, txtai, and LangGraph form the diagnostic foundation.

**Add safe tool access**: Deploy MCP servers and gateways to expose operational tools (Kubernetes, Jira, Splunk, GitHub) to your agents with proper security controls. Secure-MCP-Gateway provides a reference implementation with policy enforcement and human-in-the-loop approvals.

**Orchestrate remediation**: Integrate agentic remediation frameworks (StackStorm, Rundeck, Robusta) to let agents execute runbooks and recovery procedures based on their diagnostic findings.

**Handle console-only tools**: For systems without APIs, use browser automation frameworks (browser-use, Skyvern, Playwright) to let agents navigate web dashboards and legacy interfaces.

**Enforce governance**: Layer in compliance and safety tools (OPA, NeMo Guardrails, Falco) to constrain agent behavior, enforce policies, and maintain audit trails.

**Test and iterate**: Use simulation environments and datasets (Chaos Mesh, ADAPT-Data, OpenTelemetry Demo) to develop and validate your autonomous ops workflows before production deployment.

The goal is not to build a single monolithic "AI ops platform," but rather to compose small, well-defined, interoperable components into a system that matches your operational context and risk tolerance.
